# Conversational AI System with Jac Cloud

This repository contains the code and setup for building a state-of-the-art conversational AI system using Jac Cloud and the Jac programming language. The system leverages large language models (LLMs) and popular open-source Python libraries to create an end-to-end fully-functional chatbot.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Jaclang**: A Python superset language introducing new abstractions for AI and software development.
- **Jac-Cloud**: A runtime plugin that automates cloud server execution and deployment for Jac applications.
- **Langchain_community**: Tools and extensions for working with the LangChain ecosystem, designed to streamline the development of LLM applications.
- **Chromadb**: A vector database for storing embeddings and efficiently retrieving them for ML and NLP applications.
- **Langchain**: A framework for developing LLM applications, providing an interface to connect with various LLMs.
- **PyPDF**: A library for working with PDF files in Python, supporting text extraction, merging, and other operations.
- **Ollama**: An interface for efficiently running large language models on local hardware, compatible with cloud-based models.
- **OpenAI (optional)**: Provides access to the OpenAI API to interact with GPT models.

## Project Overview

This project follows these steps to build the conversational AI system:

1. **Setting up Jac and Jac-Cloud**: Install the required tools and libraries, and set up a Jac Cloud server.
2. **Building a RAG Chatbot with Jac Cloud and Streamlit**: Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that interacts with users.
3. **RAG + Dialogue Routing Chatbot**: Enhance the chatbot with dialogue routing functionality for better conversation management.
